        <p>One of our personal favorites is Saint's Blood by Sebestain De Castell. He mixes a marvelous amount of detail of daring and romance within this book showing a great deal of<br> of exuberating jaw dropping action that's definintely a story you'll
            love to read!</p>

        <li id="spellslinger"><em><a href="https://b-ok.cc/book/4766102/499278">Spellslinger</a></em></li>
        <p>Another one of our prized favorites is Spellslinger another entry by Sebestain De Castell himself. Again he comes with the same daring of a very relatble character that <br> doesn't always be the hero every seeks him out to be and makes actions
            that are very relatble in character that gives amazing defintion into the type of man the main character Kellen is.</p>
