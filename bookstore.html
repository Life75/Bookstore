        <li id="saints"><em><a href= "https://b-ok.cc/book/4521534/e18075">Saint's blood</a></em></li>
        <p>One of our personal favorites is Saint's Blood by Sebestain De Castell. He mixes a marvelous amount of detail of daring and romance within this book showing a great deal of<br> of exuberating jaw dropping action that's definintely a story you'll
            love to read!</p>

        <li id="spellslinger"><em><a href="https://b-ok.cc/book/4766102/499278">Spellslinger</a></em></li>
        <p>Another one of our prized favorites is Spellslinger another entry by Sebestain De Castell himself. Again he comes with the same daring of a very relatble character that <br> doesn't always be the hero every seeks him out to be and makes actions
            that are very relatble in character that gives amazing defintion into the type of man the main character Kellen is.</p>

        <li id="theredknight"><em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Knight-Traitor-Son-Cycle/dp/0316212288">The Red Knight</a></em></li>
        <p>Twenty eight florins a month is a huge price to pay, for a man to stand between you and the Wild. Twenty eight florins a month is nowhere near enough when a wyvern's jaws snap shut on your helmet in the hot stink of battle, and the beast starts
            to rip the head from your shoulders. But if standing and fighting is hard, leading a company of men - or worse, a company of mercenaries - against the smart, deadly creatures of the Wild is even harder. It takes all the advantages of birth,
            training, and the luck of the devil to do it. The Red Knight has all three, he has youth on his side, and he's determined to turn a profit. So when he hires his company out to protect an Abbess and her nunnery, it's just another job. The abby
            is rich, the nuns are pretty and the monster preying on them is nothing he can't deal with. Only it's not just a job. It's going to be a war. . .</p>

        <li id="littleBookOfStoicism"><em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Stoicism-Resilience-Confidence/dp/3952506907/ref=sr_1_2?crid=I271IR4YUN0&dchild=1&keywords=little+book+of+stoicism&qid=1597761187&s=books&sprefix=Little+book+of+stoi%2Cstripbooks%2C159&sr=1-2">The Little Book of Stoicisim</a></em></li>
        <p>Where can you find joy? Gain strength? How should we face our fears? Deal with the death of a loved one? And what about those reoccurring depressing thoughts? While traditional schooling doesn’t address such questions, it’s exactly what ancient
            schools of philosophy were all about: They taught you how to live. Even though these schools don’t exist anymore, you and I and most people are in as much need of a philosophy that guides us through life as we ever were. This compelling, highly
            actionable guide shows you how to deal more effectively with whatever life throws at you and live up to your best self. A mix of timeless wisdom and empowering advice, The Little Book of Stoicism will point the way to anyone seeking a calm
            and wise life in a chaotic world.</p>

        <li id="KnightsShadow"><em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knights-Shadow-Greatcoats-Book-2-ebook/dp/B07TV1V7SW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Knight%27s+shadow&qid=1597761411&s=books&sr=1-1">Knight's Shadow</a></em></li>
        <p>Falcio Val Mond has completed the final task given to him by the late King Paelis: he has found the King's Charoites (well, one at least). But his task isn't over, and now he, Kest and Brasti must protect the girl from those her want her dead.
            That would be simple enough, if it weren't for the renegade Knights and legendary Dashini assassins, getting in their way, not to mention the Dukes, who are desperate to hold on to their power at any cost, or Trin, the merciless daughter of
            the ruthless Duke of Rijou and the cruel Duchess of Hervor, who is determined to be Queen of Tristia. Of course, the fact that the heir to the throne is thirteen years old doesn't help, nor the fact that every day brings Falcio closer to dying
            from the poison running through his veins.</p>
